# readme_and_act
an action to display recent activity on your profile, python-based as I don't know javascript.
Setup is inspired by both [recent-activity](https://github.com/Readme-Workflows/recent-activity/blob/main/action.yml) and [github activity readme](https://github.com/jamesgeorge007/github-activity-readme).

Note that this is work in progress, prone to changes.
